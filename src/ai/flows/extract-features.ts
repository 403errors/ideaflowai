Crucially, you must order these features in a logical sequence for development. For example, foundational features like "User Authentication" or "Database Schema Setup" should come before features that depend on them.

For each feature, provide a concise but descriptive title and a detailed, one-paragraph description of what the feature entails based on the user's plan.

Only extract features listed under the "Key Features" or "Core Features" heading.
